# Maze-Manipulator-Program
PLEASE run this program with java -Xss10m TechProject
This allocate 10 megabytes of stack size, allowing for deep (7000 or more stacked calls) recursion.
Failure to do this will cause stack overflow errors
By Daniel Wisdom, including all code
Nicholas Costa helped with documenting the project for our tech teacher and other tasks

Note that the maze generation/solving algorithms were not original, and text summaries of 
each algorithm can be found on wikipedia, but all code implementation of these algorithms are soley by Daniel Wisdom
